  <summary>Software Developer Intern</summary>
  <br/>
  During this internship, I improved an existing internal plug-in suite for the Eclipse IDE and developed new plug-ins to compute and visualize software architecture design metrics.

I added multiples views to the plugin. First a summary table that would show and compute the project "code architecture" metrics. I also designed new metrics around the raw values I was able to collect on code architecture : dependency between software components, interaction between components, sometimes mixing these insight with more classical software metrics (NLOC, Cyclomatic complexity... etc). 

I also implemented a TreeMap chart that would help to localize biggest offender of the chosen metrics, and a graph chart view, to display dependencies between components.

**Technologies:** Java, Eclipse RCP, JGraphX, JFreeCharts, JTreeMap

  During this internship i had the opportunity to work on 2 projects :
  
  ***

  **Quiet Open Space project :**

  The goal of this project was to be able to visualize sound data incoming from several clients in real time on a webpage. 
  I developed a Java daemon and a server. Once deployed, the Java daemon was able to capture audio level from all the office desktop stations, and send them to the server through the websocket protocol or http according to it's configuration.
  
  The server, a 'Play' web Application written in Scala, used the daemons' inputs and made them available to the administrator. On an HTML5 webpage, using the websocket protocol, the server administrator was then able to visualize in realtime on the floor plan the noise level as an heatmap.

  **iBeacon technology research :**

  The goal of this project was to discover the iBeacon technology and help finding applications for hospitality. The app I developed to demonstrate iBeacon based notification web-service for Hospitality, was showcased at the HiTech Show in june 2014 in Los Angeles, CA.

  The app was a Cordova project, UI and logic were made in HTML5 and javascript, and was running on both Android and iOS. However, i also had to write platform-specific code in Java for Android, and in Objective-C for iOS to be able to fully utilize the iBeacon technology. The project also included the development of a notification server in NodeJS.

  Once again, I had the opportunity to work on several projects at Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise inside the professional services'​ customization team.

  The main project, was a Proof of Concept to port the "Loneworker Protection"​ feature of the aging Alcatel Lucent DECT 500 phone to Android, as a dedicated application. 
  The project included the development of fall and incidents detection algorithms in Java with Android's APIs, an HTML5 UI using ionic Framework fitting with the company's design guidelines, and notification strategies over the GSM or Enterprise networks (SIP).
  <br/>
  The app can also be connected to the Alcatel-Lucent's Open Touch Notification System by emulating the protocols used by the DECT 500, so that advanced notifications strategies can be configured by the end user when an accident is detected. It is also possible to localize the position of the event on a map, using bluetooth beacons.

  The second project was an audio conference app for Android, to ease the allocation of speaking time during company-wide conference.
